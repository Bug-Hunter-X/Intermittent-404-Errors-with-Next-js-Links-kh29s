# Next.js Intermittent Link Errors

This repository demonstrates a bug where Next.js links intermittently fail to navigate correctly, resulting in 404 errors. The issue is inconsistent; sometimes the links function as expected, other times they don't. 

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Observe the links on the page.  You may need to refresh the page multiple times to see the error consistently.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `pages` directory structure is correct and aligns with the links defined.  Additionally, verifying the Next.js configuration and build process helps rule out any conflicts.
